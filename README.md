# FutureLearn_Assessment

Welcome to my coursework for CSC8631!

This file introduces you to the coursework, which I've chosen to call 
'FutureLearn_Assessment' as it's about exploratory data analysis and data
and data management of a FutureLearn course provided by Newcastle University. 

I have used ProjectTemplate, which is an R package that helps you organise
your statistical analysis projects. To load this project, first you'll need to 
get the files from me or simply pull the code from GitHub (I've made the 
repository public, but the data is not included). You then need to `setwd()` 
into the directory where this README file is located. For convenience, it's 
called 'FutureLearn_Assessment' same as the Git repo. 

Please start by opening the Rmarkdown file in the reports folder called 
'CSC8631 Report'. Running the code from this will make sure that you get off to 
a great start! 

You'll also see that I have:
* set up the configuration and listed the R packages used in `config`;
* stored the datasets in `data` and they've loaded into `cache`;
* put preprocessing code in `munge`;
* included useful code (well... I found it useful) in `src`;
* saved the graphs created into `graphs`; and
* included a bibliography in `reports`.

Once that's done, you can have fun exploring what I've done, and build on it by 
executing any code you'd like. For new analysis you create, I'd recommend 
putting a separate file in the `src` directory.
